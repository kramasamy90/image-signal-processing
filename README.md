### Lab 1: Image Translation and Scaling
- Perform basic image transformations, including translation and scaling.

### Lab 2: Transformation Matrix and Image Warping
- Compute the transformation matrix between a source and target image using point correspondences.
- Apply the matrix to warp the source image and compute differences to identify missing objects in the target image.

### Lab 3: Homography and Image Stitching
- Estimate the homographic relationship between images.
- Transform and stitch the images to create a seamless panorama.

### Lab 4: Gaussian Blurring
- Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise and smooth details in an image.

### Lab 5: Spatial Blurring
- Implement spatial blurring techniques to achieve effects similar to Gaussian blurring.

### Lab 6: Shape from Focus
- Reconstruct the 3D shape of an object from a stack of images.
- Extract focus information using the Sum-Modified Laplacian method.
- Estimate depth at each location based on focus metrics and generate a 3D reconstruction.

### Lab 7: Exploring DFT and Phase Dominance
- Analyze the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of images.
- Explore the role of phase information and its effect on image reconstruction and rotation.

### Lab 8: Image Enhancement using Otsu's Method
- Enhance an image by computing the optimal threshold using Otsuâ€™s method for segmentation.

### Lab 9: K-Means Clustering for Image Segmentation
- Segment an image by clustering pixels based on their color values using the K-means algorithm.

### Lab 10: Non-Local Means Filtering
- Implement the Non-Local Means (NLM) algorithm to effectively reduce noise while preserving fine details.
